# Code for On Intrinsic Dataset Properties for Adversarial Machine Learning [[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09170)]

In this work, we explore the effect of two intrinsic dataset properties, input size and image contrast, on adversarial robustness, testing on five popular image classification datasets â€” MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. We find that input size and image contrast play key roles in attack and defense success. Our discoveries highlight that dataset design and data preprocessing steps are important to boost the adversarial robustness of DNNs.

## Install

This code requires the following dependencies

- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) >= 1.2.0
- Torchvision >= 0.4.0
- [ART](https://github.com/IBM/adversarial-robustness-toolbox) >= 1.2.0
- [Foolbox](https://foolbox.jonasrauber.de/) >= 3.0.0

Additionally, we evaluate on the following datasets:

- [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

To run an experiment for all datasets, use the scripts in the `scripts` directory.

```
GPU=0,1,2,3
INPUT_SIZE=32
CONTRAST=1 (leave as 1 for default contrast)

./scripts/run_{dataset_name}.sh GPU INPUT_SIZE CONTRAST
```

Due to the excessive runtime of ImageNet experiments, we recommend using the `attack_imagenet.sh` script in the `scripts` directory, as that script runs a single attack with a given epsilon value, rather than running all epsilon values and all attacks for a dataset. 

```
GPU=0,1,2,3
ATTACK=fgsm from {fgsm,bim,pgd,deepfool}
EPS=0.06274 (16/255)
INPUT_SIZE=224
CONTRAST=1 (leave as 1 for default contrast)

./scripts/run_{dataset_name}.sh GPU ATTACK EPS INPUT_SIZE CONTRAST
```
